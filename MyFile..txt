# Event Handling in React
If we want to perform a perticular task on click or hover we use events.
events are any javascript code which get executed on some event. Event 
function call is done using function calling in {} braces.
NOTE: we cannot acess state in event.

some of the many events:=
Clipboard Events
Composition Events
Keyboard Events
Focus Events
Form Events
Mouse Events
Pointer Events
Selection Events
Touch Events
UI Events
Wheel Events
Media Events
Image Events
Animation Events
Transition Events

NOTE: now if we look at our code and see that we cannot use state in our dom events 
because there this keyword dont have their scope. so to solve this we use arrow function.

BEFORE:
handleClick(e){
                console.log(this.state);
                 
            }

After:
handleClick=(e)=>{
                //console.log(e.target);
                 
            }

-----------------------------------CHANGING STATE----------------------------------------------
handleClick=(e)=>{                              // changing the state on onclick function
                //console.log(e.target);
                this.setState({
                    name: 'meenakshi'
                });
            }
