My 30 Days React Challenge

Routing in react:
for routing we first need to import react-route-dom 
this package will provide us the functionality to visite 
routes within our application through <Link> <Link/> tag
we can use our regular <a> tag but by default it will refresh the 
page which we dont want it will access  the data base again and again.

to over come this we use react router. we can also send props which contains
some use full functions which we can use.
