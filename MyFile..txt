My 30 Days React Challenge

Working with forms:
So in this we are working with forms we use onChange and on onSubmit function to handle events
and save them to the state of that component. we use setState function to add the input data to the 
state of the component.
[e.target.id]:e.target.value is used to add the input data to the state of the component.
e.preventDefault() is used to prevent the default behavior
===============================================================================================
now to send the recived state to the main component we need to pass a function as an props so that
we can us this function to send the state of Add component to the App component.
So we passed the function as prop and call it from Add component and pass the state of that component to
the function and recived that state in our App component. now create a new array of object like this:
let details = [...this.state.details,Details] and used setState function to add it to this state component.
