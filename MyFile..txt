My 30 Days React Challenge

CLI command:
npx create-react-app <nameof the app>
cd <name of the app>
npm start // to start the sserver

Nesting component:
To nest a component with another one is pretty simple 
first you have to create a new javascript file.
import react and component and create a new class
note: alwasy keep the class name in caps.

then export the file and import it in the root file 
and use it <'name of the component' />
and your nesting is done.

in this App.js is our root component and subComp.js is nested component.
