My 30 Days React Challenge

Working with Css:
in this we are learning how to add css file to the react app.
now to do this all we need to do is create a css file and import it in
any component. it doesnt matter if it is in our root component or not.
to apply css to a perticular section of the component we need to use the className
of the div.

so by doing this we can add css to the perticular div element
we can stop this by changing the config file. do the google search to follow up this.
