My 30 Days React Challenge

Props:
Props are way to pass data from parent component to the child component
in our example we have App.js as our parent and subComp is our child component

for props we need to pass the props from parent to the child in the nesting
and then recive them in the child component.

we use props to make our application dynamic. each time we can pass
different data.

passing the list of props:
to pass the list of the props we need to create state from which we will pass the 
list of props.

after passing the list we need to cycle through the list for whic we will use map function
this map function will retrun a jsx snippt which we will store in a const and then output in
the render.

function:
 const {detail }= this.props; // note: use these {} for props otherwise error
        const detailList =detail.map(make1 => {
            return (
                <div className="details" key={make1.id}>
                <h1>Name:{make1.name}</h1> 
                <h1>Age:{make1.age}</h1> 
                <h1>place:{make1.place}</h1> 
                </div>
            )
        })
